                <p>Karmine K: “I bought their Radiance 20 carat hand-crafted necklace last year. It was single-handedly the best decision I have ever made in my life other than quitting my job two years ago. I wear the necklace every day and it still hasn't lost its glow or its quality. It does not have a single scratch on it. Would totally recommend it!!”</p>
